# README file for Minesweeper game

## Project Description - Minesweeper Game

This project is a recreation of the classic game of Minesweeper, with a twist on Blizzard's popular game, Overwatch. The game's physical layout includes Overwatch-themed graphics, and as the game progresses and specific events are triggered, randomized voicelines and sound clips play to add to the experience.


## Screenshots

Users may pick any difficulty they would like; higher difficulties feature larger grids and more mines. At any point, the user can press the Reset button at the bottom to start again.

When the game is over, whether the user wins or loses, the locations of the mines on the grid will be revealed.

## Next Steps

First and foremost, while much effort was expended to hunt down and fix bugs, there will always be more to be found and addressed. Aside from this there are two main features that would be nice to implement:

* Animations

> Currently, the game's visuals are static. Given more time to investigate how to implement animations, it would go a long way to make the game more fun and immersive. For example, currently a voice line is played when a large empty area of the grid is revealed. It can be made even more visually appealing if an animation of Hanzo's sonic arrow was played at the position of the cursor to accompany his voice line.

* Responsive Design

> The game was made and designed to run on a larger monitor. Smaller devices like laptops and tablets would not be able to give the same user experience. Thus, one feature that could be investigated is making the game suitable to run on smaller displays.


## Disclaimer about Assets used

The game wouldn't be nearly as polished without the visual and audio assets used. All audio assets belong to Activision Blizzard. Similarly, the images used in this project were found online. While the wallpapers have no artist credits, the image used as the banner on the right-most column was taken from Pinterest, from the channel belonging to Wattpad.
